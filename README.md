# Legato Aptos

We're experimenting a DeFi strategy vault on Aptos allowing anyone to stake as low as 1 APT and lock-in staking APY at the vault's fixed rate and redeem at the full amount when the vault reaches maturity date regardless of any APY fluctuations.

## Getting started

Before getting started, ensure you have all the dependencies required to run the command:

```
npm run bootstrap
```

We can then run all tests by:

```
npm run test
```

And to start the frontend application:

```
npm run dev
```
